        <h1>Mythical Chimeras</h1>
        <p>
            Depending on the culture, chimeras can represent different mystical forces, from benevolent protector to devouring monster. The name-sake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)" >Greek Chimera</a> was of the latter category.

            Chimeras from a variety of cultures figure heavily in Western literature and art. Most westerners are familiar the following: gargoyle, griffin, centaur, sphynx, pegasus, and mermaid.

            Some Asian examples include the Japanese Ushi-Oni, an ox-demon with a crablike body and tusks; the half bird Kinnari from South and Southeast Asia; and the Hindu man-lion called Narasimha.
